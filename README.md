# PMD Transformer Model Tutorial

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MohamedNumair/PMD-Transformer-Model-Tutorial/blob/main/PMD_Transformer_Tutorial_collab.ipynb)

This repository serves as a comprehensive tutorial for modelling power transformers using `PowerModelsDistribution.jl`. It is designed to help users bridge the gap between intuitive "Engineering" definitions (such as those in OpenDSS) and the "Mathematical" decomposition used for optimization.

The tutorial covers:
- **Transformer Modelling Theory**: From basic principles to circuit equivalents.
- **OpenDSS Integration**: Parsing `.dss` transformer definitions into Engineering models.
- **Mathematical Decomposition**: Understanding how n-winding transformers are represented effectively in optimization models.
- **Vector Groups**: An interactive exploration of phase shifts, connection types (Delta/Wye), and winding permutations.
